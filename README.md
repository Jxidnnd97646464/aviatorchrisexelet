## Aviator Game Guide

The Aviator game is a simple game to play. The goal of the game is to
cash out your winnings before the plane crashes. The plane takes off and
flies higher and higher. The higher the plane flies, the higher the
multiplier on your bet. You can cash out your winnings at any time by
clicking on the "Cash Out" button.

There are a few things to keep in mind when playing Aviator:

-   The plane can crash at any time. There is no way to predict when the
    plane will crash, so it is important to cash out your winnings early
    on.
-   The multiplier on your bet increases as the plane flies higher. The
    higher the multiplier, the more you will win if you cash out.
-   You can place multiple bets on the same round. This can increase
    your chances of winning, but it also increases your risk of losing.
